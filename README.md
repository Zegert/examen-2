# Oefenexamen 2 
## Whats the purpose?
I got the assignment to create a website to let users fill in a enquete and create a account, teachers would have access to see all the filled in enquetes and see the users. 
So i created a dashboard for them and let them log in. The login script searches through the users and fills in which catagory they belong to.
Students can go to the login page, log in, fill in the enquete and are logged out. 
Teachers can log in and go to the dashboard where they can see all the users and filled in enquetes and create new teachers (when they are rang 3 (admin)).
## Why?
School gave me this assignment and let me create it and PHP is a long time ago for me so i used it as a fresh up.
## What do you need for this program to work?
A server with PHP (I have PHP 8.0 installed)
A MariaDB server, optional PHPMyAdmin
And a browser.
